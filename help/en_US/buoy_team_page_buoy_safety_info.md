# Viewing safety information

This page lets you view the Safety Information provided by the Buoy administrator without sending an alert to your crisis response team.

If you are an administrator, you can change this information under the [Buoy Settings](options-general.php?page=buoy_settings) option in the WordPress admin menu.
