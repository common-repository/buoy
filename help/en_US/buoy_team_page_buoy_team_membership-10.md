# Confirming crisis response team invitations

When someone adds you to their crisis response team, you must accept their invitation before you receive alerts that they send. This ensures you are not spammed with alerts from people you do not want to receive alerts from.

When you have pending invitations, they will appear under the **Accept team invitations** heading on this page. To accept the invitation, ensure the checkbox next to the invitation you want to accept is selected, and then press **Save changes** at the bottom of this page.
