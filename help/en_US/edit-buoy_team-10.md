# About your Buoy personal crisis response team

You can choose who to send emergency alerts to if you find yourself in a crisis situation. The people listed here will be notified of where you are and what you need when you activate an alert using Buoy, unless they have the word "fake" next to their name.

The people you trust must already have accounts on this website in order for you to add them to your team. If they do not yet have accounts here, or if you do not know their account name, contact them privately and ask them to sign up.

Your current team members are shown in the list below with a check mark next to their user name. A "pending" next to their name means they have not yet approved your invitation. A "fake" next to their name means they are not actually going to get alerts you send. Your team members must accept your invitation before your emergency alerts are sent to them.
