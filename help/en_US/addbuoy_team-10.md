# Adding and removing team members

To add a team member, type their user name in the "Add a team member" box. Alternatively, click or tap inside the box once to select it, then click or tap inside the box again to reveal a drop-down menu of active accounts you can add to your team. When you have entered the user name of the person you want to add to your team, click the "Save Changes" button at the bottom of this page.

If someone you know is pressuring you to add them to your team but you do not actually want them to get emergency alerts from you, check the "Add as fake team member" box to make them think they are on your team, but not actually send them any alerts.

To remove a person from your team, uncheck the checkbox next to their user name and click the "Save Changes" button at the bottom of this page. People you remove from your team will be able to see that you have removed them, so do not remove "fake" members until you feel it is safe for you to do so.
