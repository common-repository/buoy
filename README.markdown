Buoy is a decentralized 9-1-1 alternative built for and by people who are not well served by existing emergency response services. Buoy makes it easy to tell your friends where you are and what you need. Buoy's goal is a world where anyone in distress always has the option to turn to people they trust for support, rather than being forced to rely on people they don't.

Buoy is not a traditional "app" that you can download in the app store, but rather a system for adding crisis response and emergency dispatch services to existing websites. With Buoy, community groups, activist organizations, and social support service providers can quickly connect people who need help with trusted friends, family members, advocates, and other allies who can help them. It is designed to be community owned and operated, so each instance of Buoy can be customized to the unique needs or the organization or community group that hosts it.

Whether you are a group of street medics coordinating with each other during an action, citizen journalists or copwatchers watching each other's backs, domestic violence survivor support advocates, or even single parents picking each othersâ€™ kids up from school, Buoy helps you get and give peer-based mutual aid to your friends and comrades.
