	<li>If an argument seems unavoidable, stay away from any rooms such as the kitchen, bathroom, and garage where you might be trapped or there might be weapons readily available.</li>
	<li>If you can, pack a bag for you and your children with a change of clothes and all important documents such as birth certificates, social security cards, shot records, check books, ATM cards, drives license, and any medication and money you have, and put it in a safe place where you can access it quickly, like in the trunk of your car or at a friend’s house.</li>
	<li>If you choose to use alcohol or drugs it is important to be aware of the potential dangers.</li>
	<li>Teach your children how to call 911 and let them know it is okay to call if there is any violence happening.</li>
	<li>Be aware of your surroundings and others at all times.</li>
